# ParasiteCommunityTrajectory
Data and analyses used in 'Host exposure to symbionts and ecological drift generate divergence in parasite community assembly'    

Data files included: 
1. Outplant2019_infection.csv: longitudinal infection data for each outplant
2. Outplant2019_treatments.csv: description of treatment group for each outplant
3. NMDS_coordinates_outplant2019_BC_uninfectedleavesremoved: Bray-curtis NMDS coordiantes for parasite communities at the plant level. Here, I removed leaves that were never infected from the measure of plant-level severity used in the community matrix. This is the output fromt he NMDS within the R script. 

R Script:
1. outplant_trajectory_03Sept2021.Rmd: R markdown file containing all analyses

Revision files:
1. Outplant2019_infection.csv: longitudinal infection data for each outplant
2. Outplant2019_treatments.csv: description of treatment group for each outplant
3. NMDS_coordinates_outplant2019_BC_uninfectedleavesremoved: Bray-curtis NMDS coordiantes for parasite communities at the plant level. Here, I removed Epichloe negative plants from the Epichloe treatment group and leaves that were never infected from the measure of plant-level severity used in the community matrix. This is the output fromt he NMDS within the R script. 
4. outplant_trajectory_18Feb2022_revision.Rmd: R markdown file containing all analyses for revised manuscript
